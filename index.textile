h2. P = NP Softworks

h4. Expressing Human Contempt through Software Development, Inc.

This life was forged in Java and C++. It was a birthright and an expectation.

Learning soft skills, spending thousands of dollars to check off bullet points on a resume ... compromises were made and the joy of code was stifled.

But the fruit was affluence and leisure. There is now affordable time to re-examine the assumptions of what it means to live computer science.

That P is not NP, that the solution for a large number of significant and civilization-defining tasks cannot be bounded by polynomial time, it is as essential to society as the wealth of nations.

To claim this is not so -- without weight and without justification -- is civil protest. It is also mischievous, playful discordianism, a '68 spirit.

Here is some of my play.
