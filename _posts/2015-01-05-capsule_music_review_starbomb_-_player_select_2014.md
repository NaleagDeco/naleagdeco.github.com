A comedy album, but this time it’s personal (to me.) Checks all the boxes: purposely annoying voices, a tongue wedged too firmly in a cheek, and that no-rhythm all-swagger trope-rap I’m not fond of.

Between the yuk-yuk glorifications of video-game violence tho, interesting reversals about — Pacman as oppressor of a fed-up ghost populace; Being caught by the murderous left edge of a platformer game screen.

The promise of socio-political gamer take-down to be sniffed from the usual comedy upchuck. *Choice Cuts: [“Toad Joins the Band”, “Inky’s Lament”, “God of No More”]*
